# In-n-Out Challenge Calculator
#### Calculate the number of trips to In-n-Out it will take to complete the In-n-Out Challenge!

This project was inspired by @daraeman's In-n-Out Challenge. (If you haven't heard of it, you should go check it out at http://innoutchallenge.com.) The goal of the challenge is to acquire every unique receipt number given at In-n-Out. The numbers range from 1 to 99, with the exception of the number 69, leaving us with 98 unique reciept numbers.

One day, he and I wanted to figure out how long it would take us to complete the challenge. We chose to measure this in number of trips to In-n-Out. We also chose to assume that each time you go to In-n-Out, you place one single order, and have an equal chance of receiving any of the 98 numbers.

After attempting to solve this problem with pen and paper, we concluded that the best way to approach it would be to write a program to do it for us. The code in this repo is very similar to my original implementation of the calculator, but @daraeman has since improved the design and added additional functionality that you can check out at http://calc.innoutchallenge.com.

(If you're curious, we've found that the average number of trips required is about 505.)
